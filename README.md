Predicting crude oil prices for this dataset. This dataset has date and corresponding crude oil price in dollars. Crude oil price market prediction is known for its obscurity and complexity. Due to its high uncertainty degree, irregular events, and the complex correlations with the market, it is indeed difficult to predict its movement.

The data is freely available here-https://www.kaggle.com/rockbottom73/crude-oil-prices#Crude%20Oil%20Prices%20Daily.xlsx

Our Goal is to predict the future price of the oil by using RNN-LSTM(Recurrent Neural Network)(Long Short Term Memory) using keras
